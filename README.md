Handcrafted by Suraj Bahadur and Navneet Choudry


Introduction
The Faculty support system is a webapp that was built to eliminate the time and effort, which is wasted in taking attendances in schools and colleges. It also greatly reduces the amount of paper resources needed in attendance data management.
 It is built to be used for school/college faculty so that they may take student attendance on their laptop as well as phone.
Purpose
The purpose of developing the product is to computerized the traditional way of talking attendance.
 The faculty can send notification to the student who are absent and all the student regarding any alert.
Scope
The project is developed as a web app i.e. any system that has access to internet is able to run the app
Technology 

Front End: HTML,CSS
Backend: PHP,MySQL
System Requirement
 	RAM: 2GB
HARD DISK: 500GB
Processor: i3
OS: Windows 7 v22.5.0/ Mac OS X v10.5
Economically Feasibility: 
The system being developed is economic with respect to college point of view It is cost effective in the sense that has eliminated the paper work completely. 
Technical Feasibility: 
The technical requirement for the system is economic and it does not use any other additional Hardware and software. 
Behavioral Feasibility: 
	The system working is quite easy to use and learn due to its simple but attractive interface. User requires no special training for operating the system. 
Working Of Present System
	In the present system, all work is done on paper. The whole session attendance is stored in register and at the end of the session the reports are generated. Even though the attendance can be converted into digital format, it's a tedious process.

DISADVANTAGES OF PRESENT WORKING SYSTEM 
	• Not User Friendly: The existing system is not user friendly because the retrieval of data is very slow and data is not maintained efficiently. 
• Difficulty in report generating: We require more calculations to generate the report so it is generated at the end of the session. And the student not get a single chance to improve their attendance
 • Manual control: All calculations to generate report is done manually so there is greater chance of errors. 
• Lots of paperwork: Existing system requires lot of paperwork. Loss of even a single register/record led to difficult situation because all the papers are needed to generate the reports. 
• Time consuming: Every work is done manually so we cannot generate report in the middle of the session or as per the requirement because it is very time consuming. 
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PROPOSED SYSTEM

• User Friendly:- The proposed system is user friendly because the retrieval and storing of data is fast and data is maintained efficiently. Moreover the graphical user interface is provided in the proposed system, which provides user to deal with the system very easily. 
• Reports are easily generated: reports can be easily generated in the proposed system so user can generate the report as per the requirement (monthly) or in the middle of the session. User can give the notice to the students with the notification
 • Very less paperwork: The proposed system requires very less paper work. All the data is feted into the computer immediately and reports can be generated through computers. Moreover work become very easy because there is no need to keep data on papers.
